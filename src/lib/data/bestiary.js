      <p>These Basic Scavengers may seem primitive, but don't underestimate them, its strength lies in numbers, as even a modest swarm can swiftly dispatch unwary Helldivers. Despite its diminutive stature, it boasts surprising resilience, capable of felling a Helldiver with a mere handful of strikes.</p>
      <h3>Bile Spitter</h3>
      <p>Ah, the juvenile Bile Spitter, still in its larval stage, it's armed with a short-range bile-spit in addition to its claws. This nasty little critter's job is to ensnare and slow down its prey, making it easier for the rest of the swarm to close in. You'll often see them patrolling alongside other young horrors, casting a shadow of dread wherever they go.</p>
      <h3>Hopper</h3>
      <p>Young and agile, the Hopper, akin to a fledgling Hunter, bounds across the battlefield in the early stages of conflict and beyond.

      <h3>Nursing Spewers</h3>
      <p>Targeting the back of Bile Spewers with explosives or aiming for their heads is the most effective method of neutralizing these noxious foes. Explosives and armor-piercing ammunition can exploit their vulnerabilities and swiftly dispatch them.</p>
      <p>A well-placed grenade or railgun shot to the head can often incapacitate or eliminate Spewers with ease, while high-explosive rounds from a grenade launcher can neutralize them in just a few shots.</p>

Its hulking frame and swift movements make it a daunting adversary, capable of unleashing devastating charges against unsuspecting Helldivers. There are two variants of the Charger, believed to be a male and female variants, but no mating patterns have been observed. The \"bull\" appears to be more heavily armored, but in practice they are equal in resillience, strength, and intelligence.",
    quicktip: "Their armor is next to impenetrable, but as is customary with bugs, their biggest weakness is their head. A well aim shot of heavy artillery will instantly take them out. Otherwise target their legs with heavy armor-piercing weapons or explosives to reveal their weak spots. Keep your distance, use obstacles, and coordinate with your squadmates to outmaneuver these armored behemoths.",

    tactics: `
      <p>When facing down a Charger, forget subtlety and finesse - this is a battle of brute force and rapid response. Chargers are the armored juggernauts of the Terminid horde, bulldozing their way through anything that stands in their path.</p>
      <p>Your best bet for taking down these armored monstrosities? Aim for the head for the big guns. A well placed heavy explosive round will instantly send them to bug heaven. If you didn't bring your glassses, instead aim for their legs with your heaviest armor-piercing weaponry and blast away until you see sparks fly. Break through their armored plating, and you'll reveal the juicy bits underneath - aim for those, and you'll be sending these oversized bugs back to the scrap heap in no time.</p>
      <p>But if you're short on anti-armor firepower, fear not - explosives are your best friend. Lob a grenade or call in an airstrike to create weak spots in their tough exterior, then unload everything you've got into those chinks in their armor. It's like cracking open a nut - if the nut was the size of a small tank and wanted to crush you into paste.</p>
      <p>Remember, when tangling with Chargers, it's all about staying one step ahead of their thunderous charges. Keep your distance, use obstacles to your advantage, and work together with your squadmates to outmaneuver these armored behemoths. And whatever you do, don't let them get too close - you'll regret it faster than you can say "bug squashed."</p>

      <p>When facing off against a Brood Commander, you're in for a fight unlike any other. These armored behemoths may be slower than their brethren, but make no mistake - they're just as deadly. They bring a whole swarm of critters along with them, ready to unleash chaos at a moment's notice. But fear not, Helldiver, for where there's armor, there's weakness. While the Brood Commander may be encased in thick plating, its limbs are vulnerable targets ripe for destruction. Aim true and blast away at its legs, sending chunks of armor flying and slowing its advance to a crawl.</p>
      <p>And don't be fooled by its headless charge - even without a noggin, this beast is still a force to be reckoned with. Keep your distance, stay on the move, and rain down a hail of bullets until it collapses in a heap of twisted metal and shattered dreams.</p>
      <p>But beware - victory comes at a price. Should you fail to finish the job, the Brood Commander will unleash a berserker fury, gaining speed and strength in its final moments as it lashes out with a ferocity unmatched by any other Terminid.

      <p>But fear not, for where there's a will, there's a way - and with the right strategy, even the mightiest Titan can be brought to its knees. When confronting one of these hulking monstrosities, remember the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Your Distance:</strong> The Bile Titan's acid attacks are devastating, capable of melting through armor and flesh alike. Maintain a safe distance at all times, and avoid getting caught in the crossfire.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordinate with Your Teammates:</strong> Bait the Titan and work together to exploit its weaknesses. While it's focused on one Helldiver, the others can target its vulnerable spots and chip away at its armor.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Terrain to Your Advantage:</strong> Seek cover behind rocks, buildings, and other obstacles to evade the Titan's attacks. High ground can also give you a strategic advantage, allowing you to rain down fire from above while staying out of harm's way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for targeting the Titan's weak spots, aim for its mouth and the vulnerable sacs beneath its body. These are the points where its armor is thinnest, making them prime targets for your firepower.

      <p>Upon detecting the scent of your heroism, the Factory Strider lets out a bone-chilling roar, and its cannon gets straight to work. It spits out up rounds of searing death if you dare to linger in its line of sight. If that's not personal enough, its high RPM Gatling lasers (aimed via its robotic head) will make Swiss cheese out of anything unfortunate enough to stand in front of it.

    name: "Gunship",
    appearance: "After weeks of relentless attempts at aerial supremacy, the Automatons have finally made a breakthrough: the dropships are UAVs armed to the teeth with rockets, cannons, and other artillery. They patrol overhead, guarding their fabricators with relentless ferocity and are capable of reinforcing the Automaton ground forces, creating an impenetrable wall of firepower.",
    quicktip: "Coordinate with your team to split up their attention and draw their fire, allowing positional advances onto the base of the fabricator. Once in position, call in Hellbomb, run for the hills, and watch the sparks fly.",
    tactics: `
      <p>While is it entirely possible to evade gunship fabricators, the SEAF infantry back home would have a heap of trouble dealing with them in the cleanup process. Therefore, it's encouraged that Helldivers deal with the threat whenever possible. Destroying the gunship is quite easy; one shot with a Heavy Weaponry will send a gunship back to the scrapyard.</p>
      <p>The best way to defend against gunships is simple; utilize cover. Despite their intense barrage of lasers and rockets, their onslaught is incapable of penetrating the rough terrain of the planet soil. Duck behind rocks, buildings, into divots, anything that can stand between you and scanning searchlight of the gunship. However, be warned: Gunships have been known to swarm teams of Helldivers en masse, leaving no vantage point unturned and no place to hide from imminent annihilation. Know when to retreat, and live to fight another day.</p>
      <p>To deal with the threat for good, divers must infiltrate the territory of the gunship fabricator and clear out automaton resistance. Once available, call in a Hellbomb at the base of the fabricator towers and begin the detonation sequence. If all goes well, you and your teammates can watch the fireworks from a distance as the Automatons are sent back to their makers</p>

These imposing vessels loom ominously over the battlefield, their sleek and streamlined design hinting at the formidable firepower they carry within.",
    quicktip: "Target their thrusters with high-caliber weaponry to ground them swiftly, but beware of the ensuing explosion.",
    tactics: `
      <p>Confronting Dropships demands impeccable timing and cunning strategy. Crafted for swift deployment, these formidable vessels lack an obvious Achilles' heel, necessitating Helldivers to employ ingenuity to neutralize them and halt the influx of additional Automaton soldiers.</p>
      <p>Taking aim at the thrusters with high-caliber weaponry like the recoilless rifle or disposable anti-tank ordnance can swiftly ground the Dropship, causing it to plummet and potentially squash any Automatons onboard. Yet, caution is paramount to evade the ensuing explosion or being pinned beneath the wreckage.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, intercepting the Dropship before it disgorges its payload by targeting the bots during its deployment sequence can disrupt its mission and obstruct reinforcements from joining the fray. Utilize explosive ordnance to hasten the process, but remain wary of the hazards inherent in engaging the Dropship up close.</p>
      <p>When confronting Dropships, prioritize coordination and communication with your comrades to maximize your efficacy and minimize the peril they pose. By pinpointing their vulnerabilities and deploying strategic maneuvers, you can thwart the Automatons' endeavors to fortify their positions and secure triumphant glory for Super Earth.</p>
